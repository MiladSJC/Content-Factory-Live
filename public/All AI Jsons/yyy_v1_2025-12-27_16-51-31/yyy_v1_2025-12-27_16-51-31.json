The background is a solid vibrant green (#009639), with a smooth, matte texture and even lighting. Place the product prominently in the center with a slight shadow for depth. Typography hierarchy: The product name is in bold white uppercase sans-serif font, aligned to the top-right corner, smaller than the price text. The price is bold, black, and prominently displayed in a large sans-serif font, with the price per unit in a smaller, thinner font just below it. Both texts are right-aligned. A bright yellow badge is positioned on the right side, mid-height, featuring a rectangular shape with slightly rounded corners and a bold red dollar symbol inside a circle on the right edge of the badge. Ensure the layout is clean, with balanced spacing between elements for a modern retail aesthetic."
